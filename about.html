    <h1>ABOUT COLLEGE</h1>
    <main>
        A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, 
        a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.
    </main>

    <p>
        In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications,
         a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. 
         In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may 
         be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and 
         accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.[1] The word is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US.[2] Colleges in countries 
         such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.

    <h3>HISTORY</h3> </h3>
    <p>
        The Department of History started in 1990 maintains its highest academic standards with laurels of victory. In 2001 the department was raised to a PG 
        Department with the introduction of MA History. BA Museology and Archaeology under the UGC Innovative Programme in 2005 is yet another landmark in the progress of 
        the Department. A great triumph of the Department was the establishment of a unique historical wonder- The Assumption Heritage Museum in 2008. The Department has to its 
        credit an approved Research Centre (No. AC AVI/3668/RG/06 dated 29-05-2007) of the M G University with course work since 2008. Over the years the Department has emerged 
        as a Centre of higher learning and research with a good number of research guides and scholars and organizes a series of intercollegiate and intra collegiate competitions, 
        lecture series and events.
